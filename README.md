## Contributing

Pull Requests from our design, development and operations teams of [Haufe.Group](https://www.haufegroup.com/en/) and its subsidiaries are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before we are more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request. 

The short version of it is to fork this repo your own account and then clone it locally and add your changes. You can easily run Jekyll locally using docker. Simply `cd` into your `Haufe-Lexware.github.io` fork containing your changes, and then issue the following command:

```sh
$ docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll -it -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:pages jekyll serve
```

If everything works out, the jekyll server will serve the blog preview on `http://127.0.0.1:4000`. Once you verified that your changes render without error, you can submit a pull request against out blog repo.

Please note to set the proxy if you are working from within the Haufe Intranet

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://10.12.1.236:8083/
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.12.1.236:8083/

If you find bugs or issues you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/Haufe-Lexware.github.io/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

### Credits

Support for Categories and Tags were inspired by [this blog entry](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/). A list of the defined categories and tags can be found at `_data/categories.yml` and `_data\tags.yml` respectively. If you want to add new categories or tags, you need to add them to the corresponding `.yml` file and add the matching template into the `meta/category` or `meta/tag` directories. Please do not go overboard with adding new categories and tags but try to stay within the ones we have. On the other hand - if you feel strongly about adding one, feel free to submit a pull request.

Author support was inspired by [this blog entry](https://blog.sorryapp.com/blogging-with-jekyll/2014/02/06/adding-authors-to-your-jekyll-site.html). In order to add information on a new author, edit the `_data/authors.yml` file, then use the new key as `author` link in the posts. If an author cannot be found in `authors.yml`, the content of the `author` tag will be used verbose. In that case, no links to any social media (Twitter, Github and LinkedIn are currently supported) will be included.
