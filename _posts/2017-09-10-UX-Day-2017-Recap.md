On June the 27th our Design Office organized the **first international UX Day**. It was a day organized in the headquarters of Freiburg and included not only UX / UI Designers, but also Frontend & Fullstack Devs as well as colleagues out of all business units of the Haufe Group. Partipants traveled abroad from Hannover, Bielefeld, Switzerland and even as far as Barcelona. What made people come to that event? What was it's content and context? And what did we take away personally of this day? Let me share our experiences with you.

## What was our Motivation and Goals for an UX Day
hier etwas über den Hintergrund schreiben warum ein Unternehmen UX + Design in den Mittelpunkt rücken sollte und allen anbieten sollte sich zu dem Thema zu verknüfen.

User Experience is important for a company like Haufe Group. Since the company transformed from a publishing to a digital driven company, UX und Design gain more and more in importance.

There's a quote I like very much:

> "UX is a team discipline, not an individual sport. UX is everyone's business." #WhitehatUX

Being an international company of about 1.900 people and having a larg number of different solutions and products, we needed to start an exchange of experiences about trends and standards. So building networks in a big company like the Haufe Group is essential - and it should extent the borders of only UX and UI designers.

So additionally to connecting UX experts with each other, we wanted to place UX and UI topics in everybodys mind - not depending whether the audience is a product owner, a product manager, a marketer or an webdeveloper.

- internal and external speakers. talks and workshops. experiences out of projects, best practises, best tools, best examples.

What was our goal doing that?
We wanted that at the end of the day each attendee would take sth little for himself home. Sth that he could adapt for his daily work. That he would get to now new persons in the Haufe Group. Have new inspiration for new inventions. Have learned sth.


## How to organize an UX Day that inspires others

Here our 5 learnings how to set up an in-house event:

Everyone loves goodies, so 

### Start with an eye-opener
